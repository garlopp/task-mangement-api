# Task Management Application Documentation

## Overview

This Task Management Application is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, as well as share tasks with others via email.

## Design and Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

*   **Routers:** Handle incoming HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate functions. (`routers/task.py`, `routers/auth.py`)
*   **CRUD Operations:** Implement the core logic for interacting with the database. (`crud/task.py`, `crud/shared_task.py`)
*   **Schemas:** Define the data models used for request and response validation. (`schemas.py`)
*   **Database Models:** Represent the database tables using SQLAlchemy ORM. (`models.py`)
*   **Dependencies:** Manage dependencies like database sessions and user authentication. (`utils/deps.py`)
*   **Email Sender:** Handles sending email notifications for task sharing. (`utils/email_sender.py`)
*   **Configuration:** Stores application settings. (`config.py`)

## Constraints and Challenges

*   **User Authentication:** Implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure the API endpoints.
*   **Database Interaction:** Used SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions, allowing for flexibility in choosing the database.
*   **Task Sharing:** Introduced a mechanism to share tasks via email, generating unique tokens for secure access.
*   **Error Handling:** Implemented exception handling to manage various error scenarios, such as task not found or email sending failures.

## Possible Improvements

*   **More Robust Authentication:** Consider adding features like password reset, account verification, or integration with third-party authentication providers.
*   **Enhanced Task Sharing:** Allow users to specify permissions when sharing tasks (e.g., read-only, edit).
*   **Asynchronous Tasks:** For long-running operations like sending emails, use asynchronous task queues (e.g., Celery) to improve performance.
*   **Testing:** Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the application's reliability.
*   **Input Validation:** Add more constraints to the input validation to properly handle edge cases and prevent invalid data from being saved into the database.
